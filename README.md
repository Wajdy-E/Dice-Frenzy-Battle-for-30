# Dice-Frenzy-Battle-for-30
Short dice game built using html/css/js.
How it works: Two players, one roll each. Roll high, but watch out for those tricky "ones" – they end your turn and pass the baton to your rival. Your call: keep rolling (no "ones," please) or pass the dice. First to 30 points wins! But beware: double "ones" (snake eyes) reset your score to zero. Roll smart, aim high! 😄🏆
